<p align="center">Recently, I had the chance to visit Cox’s Bazar, the longest natural sea beach in the world —
     and it was every bit as beautiful as I’d imagined.
      From the moment I arrived, the sound of the waves crashing against the shore and the smell of salty sea air felt like 
      an escape from everything
    The mornings were peaceful, with fishermen casting their nets and beachgoers enjoying the early light. I spent hours just sitting by the water, letting the breeze clear my mind. The food was also a highlight
       — fresh seafood, especially grilled prawns and fish, tasted even better with a view of the ocean</p>
<p>The plan to visit cox was quite sudden,did so many activities with my brother.Went on a drive through marine road.
    The rain came gently at first-There was a strange kind of freedom in it — no shelter, no rush, just me and the storm, riding together like old friends. The rain didn’t soak me; it baptized me. It didn’t slow me down; it turned my journey into poetry on wheels.

And for a moment, I wasn’t escaping the storm — I was part of it.(this time I had a good visual,I could see the road properly.)
